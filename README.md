### About Surge

Surge is built on a modern API-first architecture, designed from the ground up to be programmable and composable. Every feature available in the CLI is accessible via the API, making it easy to integrate into automated workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and custom tooling.

This API-first approach makes Surge well-suited for AI-driven workloads where agents and automated systems need to deploy, update, and manage web properties at scale. Whether you're building AI-powered development tools, automated content pipelines, or agent-based systems that publish to the web, Surge provides the infrastructure to support high-volume, programmatic deployments.
